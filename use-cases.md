# Use Cases

#### Here are some common scenarios which point to the need of a supergraph:
1. You're starting to evaluate the need of a federated data access layer
2. API consumers wish they had a monolithic API view of their microservice APIs
3. API consumers want GraphQL, but API producers don't want to maintain GraphQL services
5. You're trying to make your API gateway work as an API integration or orchestration layer
6. You're thinking about API standardization for creating flexible data APIs
7. You want to replace direct database access with APIs
8. You want to deliver data products or a data mesh over an API
9. You want to deliver knowledge graph for enabling data retrieval for AI applications

#### In all of the situations above, the key problem is the lack of a strategy and an architecture to operationalize the strategy:
1. API consumers are frustrated by the lack of APIs that are optimized for their specific data retrieval use cases
2. API producers are not willing to take on the burden of maintaining and operationalizing API aggregation and composition problems
3. There is no operating model or ownership model for who should solve the integration problem
